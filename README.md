# Fractal–Spectral Replication MVT  
**Independent, Open, Reproducible Test of FractiAI’s HFG Phase-Residual Claim (ℑₑₛ) Against Public Spectral/PES Data and Max-Planck 2024 Fractal Enzyme Findings**

## Overview
This repository hosts a complete, open, 3-day **Minimal Viable Test (MVT)** designed to independently evaluate a key claim from the **FractiAI / Holographic Fractal Grammar (HFG)** framework:

> **Does the reported phase-residual ℑₑₛ ≈ 1.137 × 10⁻³ persist under independent replication using public HCOOH/CH₄ spectra, PES data, model sweeps, noise bootstraps, and alternative line-shape functions?**

The test is built to be:
- **Fully reproducible**  
- **Conservative & skeptic-friendly**  
- **Aligned with best practices for spectral/PES analysis**  
- **Compatible with the 2024 Nature finding of a natural Sierpiński fractal enzyme (citrate synthase)**

This repo is structured to allow external reviewers (including Max-Planck researchers) to reproduce every step end-to-end.

## Scientific Motivation

### 1. Background from Max Planck (Sendker et al., *Nature*, 2024)
A landmark 2024 study demonstrated that **citrate synthase naturally evolves fractal Sierpiński geometries**.  
This provides the first hard biological evidence of **native biochemical fractal morphogenesis**, opening the door to evaluating other fractal-based biochemical hypotheses.

### 2. FractiAI / HFG Claim
FractiAI reports a persistent **phase-residual** signal (ℑₑₛ) in formic-acid to methane pathways, allegedly robust to traditional QC methods but visible under the HFG pipeline.

This repository provides a neutral, transparent, open test of that claim.

## Goals of the MVT
### **Primary Scientific Question**
Does ℑₑₛ emerge as a statistically significant, reproducible structure **independent of FractiAI’s own environment**, under:

- Voigt ↔ Lorentz ↔ Gaussian line-shape models  
- Basis-set sweeps  
- Noise/bootstrapped null tests  
- NIST spectral data  
- Public PES curves  
- Cross-validation with the 2024 fractal-enzyme geometries  

### **Secondary Goals**
- Provide a clean open-science artifact for external verification  
- Create a foundation for correspondence with Max-Planck researchers  
- Identify whether fractal coherence is meaningful or modeling-fragile
